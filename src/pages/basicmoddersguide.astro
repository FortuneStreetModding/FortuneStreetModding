    In order to rip a Wii disc, a storage device with more than 4.38 GiB of free space is recommended. However, by dividing the disc into chunks, an SD card or USB with even a single gibibyte of free space is sufficient.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
    At the CleanRip Setup screen, set Chunk Size to "Max", and New device per chunk to "No" is recommended with SD cards or external USB storage devices large enough to hold the entirety of the ripped disc file at once. Otherwise, set Chunk Size to max possible ("1GB", "2GB", "3GB", or "Max") and set New device per chunk to "Yes" and when CleanRip is asking for the next device, remove it from the Wii and move the first or so ISO file to free up space and use it again. When all pieces have been received, check in the next subsection.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
CleanRip will split the ripped disc file with more than 4 GiB in file size regardless to fit the FAT, FAT16, or FAT32 file systems. These file systems have a max file size of 4 GiB. To remedy this, it is recommended to rip discs to a USB external NTFS formatted storage device (as Wii cannot read NTFS formatted SD cards). The NTFS file system has a theoretical max file size of 16 EiB (Exabyte), or 16,777,216 GiB.
