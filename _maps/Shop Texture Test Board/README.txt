Next time try testing the board BEFORE you upload it, huh? Sorry about that, guys.

This board is designed to facilitate extraction of the various shop texture files for each character color. Thus, it contains 4 shops of each model (1-7 stars) and 4 vacant plots. The player can infinitely loop around each section of the board to make it easier to grab each shop in their section.

This isn't a board designed to be fun (or even played casually at all) so there's only an .frb file here. None of the bells and whistles for a proper community board.
